## Installation Instructions:

Requires NodeJS and NPM.

Clone the repo and run `npm install`.

Run `npm run build` to build everything.

Run `npm run serve` to locally serve, it will open a browser window to localhost.

That's it! You can now do development on the site!

### Advanced Options:

Run `npm run watchtsc` and `npm run watchsass` to run the compilers in watch mode so you dont have to run build every time you update something.

Have fun!
